								<h4>2.1. Job Applications.</h4>
									<p>For guests who are viewing this page through my job applications: 
									the reason I apply for your positions,

									The experience of collaboration is valuable to me as well. </p>
								<hr />
								<h3>3. What am I believing?</h3>
									<p>I believe that the universe can be finally described by mathematical equations or statistical models. I was and will be continuing my quest with every accumulation on my way, devoting myself to reach a new frontier, to be an explorer, similar to those captains in the Age of Discovery.</p>

								<h3>5. Something I would share.</h3>
									<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6LeM3zg8UVOTeqVRUIlS2V?si=x0vfUiEDTbGyX1eNCW40WQ">BWV 974: II. Adagio.</a> Concerto in D minor after Alessandro Marcello. by Glenn Gould</p>
								<hr />
								<h3>6. My opinion on fundamental analysis and technical analysis.</h3>
									<p>Yes I use both types in my financial analysis. I would prefer fundamental analysis as I believe those fundamental motivations are the force of market.
										However, the reason of applying technical analysis is that we do not have enough and latest information as the major funds. Hence, as an individual investor, we have to follow the movement of big funds who can make and change the market trends.
										Technical analysis provides a method to figure out the potential footprints of major funds. We then rely on technical analysis to catch the influence of unknown information.
